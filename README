This is my intro project in Play/Slick/Postgresql

It have to emulate the natural processing of the university entree campaign.
I hope it really make it.

To run it you have to create database from dump(db_test_dump.sql) and
run Web-server with application.

Good luck.

It is my first big project on Scala, so please don't judge me very hard.
We all were dummies in everything we started to learn.
